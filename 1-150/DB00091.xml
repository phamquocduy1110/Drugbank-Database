  <name>Cyclosporine</name>
  <description>Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor known for its immunomodulatory properties that prevent organ transplant rejection and treat various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. It is isolated from the fungus _Beauveria nivea_.[A174049] Initially manufactured by Sandoz and approved for use by the FDA in 1983, cyclosporine is now available in various products by Novartis (previously known as Sandoz).[L11097,L3734,L11118]</description>

  <indication>Cyclosporine is approved for a variety of conditions. Firstly, it is approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in allogeneic kidney, liver, and heart transplants. It is also used to prevent bone marrow transplant rejection. For the above indications, cyclosporine can be used in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Finally, cyclosporine can be used in patients who have chronic transplant rejection and have received previous immunosuppressive therapy[L3002] and to prevent or treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).[L11097]&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, cyclosporine is used for the treatment of patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when they no longer respond to methotrexate alone.[L3734] It can be used for the treatment of adult non-immunocompromised patients with severe, recalcitrant, plaque psoriasis that have failed to respond to at least one systemic therapy or when systemic therapies are not tolerated or contraindicated.[L3734] The ophthalmic solution of cyclosporine is indicated to increase tear production in patients suffering from keratoconjunctivitis sicca.[L11097] In addition, cyclosporine is approved for the treatment of steroid dependent and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome due to glomerular diseases which may include minimal change nephropathy, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranous glomerulonephritis.[L11097]&#13;
&#13;
Off-label, cyclosporine is commonly used for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis, blistering disorders, ulcerative colitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis, connective tissue diseases, as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.[A139,A174085,A189393,A189396,A189399]</indication>
  <pharmacodynamics>Cyclosporine exerts potent immunosuppressive actions on T cells, thereby prolonging survival following organ and bone marrow transplants.[L3734] This drug prevents and controls serious immune-mediated reactions including allograft rejection,  graft versus host disease, and inflammatory autoimmune disease.[L3734]&#13;
&#13;
Some notable effects of cyclosporine are hypertrichosis, gingival hyperplasia, and hyperlipidemia. There is also some debate about this drug causing nephrotoxicity.[A189402]&#13;
</pharmacodynamics>
  <mechanism-of-action>Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits T cell activation.[A174049,A174088,A189411] Its binding to the receptor cyclophilin-1 inside cells produces a complex known as cyclosporine-cyclophilin. This complex subsequently inhibits calcineurin, which in turn stops the dephosphorylation as well as the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) that normally cause inflammatory reactions.  NF-AT is a transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the inflammatory process. Specifically, the inhibition of IL-2, which is necessary for T cell activation or proliferation, is believed to be responsible for cyclosporine's  immunosuppressive actions.[A174049,A189408] In addition to the above, the inhibition of NF-AT leads to lower levels of other factors associated with T helper cell function and thymocyte development.[A174049]</mechanism-of-action>
  <toxicity>The oral LD50 in rats is 1480 mg/kg and the TDLO in humans is 12 mg/kg.[L11085] &#13;
&#13;
**Overdose information**&#13;
&#13;
In cases of overdose with oral cyclosporine, forced emesis and gastric lavage are recommended 2 hours after ingestion. There are little data available in the literature regarding overdoses with cyclosporine, but hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur.[L3734] One case report of an cyclosporine overdose due to medical error was made involving a 26 year old female and noted the occurrence of nausea, flushing, tremor, vertigo and vomiting, which resolved within about 1 day. Anorexia and a feeling of increased body girth were also experienced by this patient and resolved within about 2 weeks.[A189453] When overdose with cyclosporine is observed, it is important to consider that dialysis and charcoal, hemoperfusion are not effective techniques to remove cyclosporine from the body.[L3734]&#13;
&#13;
</toxicity>
  <metabolism>Cyclosporine is metabolized in the intestine and the liver by CYP450 enzymes, predominantly CYP3A4 with contributions from CYP3A5.[A174049,A189402] The involvement of CYP3A7 is not clearly established.[A189402] Cyclosporine undergoes several metabolic pathways and about 25 different metabolites have been identified. One of its main active metabolites, AM1, demonstrates only 10-20% activity when compared to the parent drug, according to some studies.[A174088,A189402]&#13;
&#13;
The 3 primary metabolites are M1, M9, and M4N, which are produced from oxidation at the 1-beta, 9-gamma, and 4-N-demethylated positions, respectively.[A189402]</metabolism>
  <absorption>The absorption of cyclosporine occurs mainly in the intestine.[A174049,A189405] Absorption of cyclosporine is highly variable with a peak bioavailability of 30% sometimes occurring 1-8 hours after administration with a second peak observed in certain patients.[A174088,L11097] The absorption of cyclosporine from the GI tract has been found to be incomplete, likely due to first pass effects.[A189402] Cmax in both the blood and plasma occurs at approximately 3.5 hours post-dose.[L3002]&#13;
&#13;
A note on erratic absorption&#13;
&#13;
During chronic administration, the absorption of Sandimmune Soft Gelatin Capsules and Oral Solution have been observed to be erratic, according to Novartis prescribing information.  Those being administered the soft gelatin capsules or oral solution over the long term should be regularly monitored by testing cyclosporine blood concentrations and adjusting the dose accordingly.[L3002] When compared with the other oral forms of Sandimmune, Neoral capsules and solution have a higher rate of absorption that results in a higher Tmax and a 59% higher Cmax with a 29 % higher bioavailability.[L3002]&#13;
</absorption>
  <half-life>The half-life of cyclosporine is biphasic and very variable on different conditions but it is reported in general to last 19 hours.[A174088] Prescribing information also states a terminal half-life of approximately 19 hours, but with a range between 10 to 27 hours.[L3002]</half-life>
  <protein-binding>About 50% of the administered dose is taken up by erythrocytes while about 34% is bound to lipoproteins.[A174088] Prescribing information for Sandimmune states that 90% is mainly bound to lipoproteins.[L3002]&#13;
 </protein-binding>
  <route-of-elimination>After sulfate conjugation, cyclosporine remains in the bile where it is broken down to the original compound and then re-absorbed into the circulation. Cyclosporine excretion is primarily biliary with only 3-6%[A189402,L3002] of the  dose (including the parent drug and metabolites) excreted in the urine while 90% of the administered dose is eliminated in the bile. From the excreted proportion, under 1% of the dose is excreted as unchanged cyclosporine.[A174088,L3002] </route-of-elimination>
  <volume-of-distribution>The distribution of cyclosporine in the blood consists of 33%-47% in plasma, 4%-9% in the lymphocytes, 5%-12% in the granulocytes, and 41%-58% in the erythrocytes.[L3002]  The reported volume of distribution of cyclosporine ranges from 4-8 L/kg. It  concentrates mainly in leucocyte-rich tissues as well as tissues that contain high amounts of fat because it is highly lipophilic.[A189402] Cyclosporine, in the eye drop formulation, crosses the blood-retinal barrier.[A174088,A189450]</volume-of-distribution>
  <clearance>Cyclosporin shows a linear clearance profile that ranges from 0.38 to 3 Lxh/kg[A174088], however, there is substantial inter- patient variability.[A189402] A 250 mg dose of cyclosporine in the oral soft gelatin capsule of a lipid micro-emulsion formulation shows an approximate clearance of 22.5 L/h.[A189453]</clearance>

        <specific-function>PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. Involved in regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). It is proposed that its association with the mPTP is masking a binding site for inhibiting inorganic phosphate (Pi) and promotes the open probability of the mPTP leading to apoptosis or necrosis; the requirement of the PPIase activity for this function is debated. In cooperation with mitochondrial TP53 is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis. Involved in modulation of mitochondrial membrane F(1)F(0) ATP synthase activity and regulation of mitochondrial matrix adenine nucleotide levels. Has anti-apoptotic activity independently of mPTP and in cooperation with BCL2 inhibits cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis.</specific-function>

        <specific-function>Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4-hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. Acts as a 1,8-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide (PubMed:11159812). Catalyzes 4-beta-hydroxylation of cholesterol. May catalyze 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in vitro (PubMed:21576599).</specific-function>

        <general-function>Sodium-independent organic anion transmembrane transporter activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>Involved in the renal elimination of endogenous and exogenous organic anions. Functions as organic anion exchanger when the uptake of one molecule of organic anion is coupled with an efflux of one molecule of endogenous dicarboxylic acid (glutarate, ketoglutarate, etc). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) (By similarity). Mediates the sodium-independent uptake of p-aminohippurate (PAH), ochratoxin (OTA), acyclovir (ACV), 3'-azido-3-'deoxythymidine (AZT), cimetidine (CMD), 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetate (2,4-D), hippurate (HA), indoleacetate (IA), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate (CMPF), cidofovir, adefovir, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) guanine (PMEG), 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) diaminopurine (PMEDAP) and edaravone sulfate. PAH uptake is inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulphonate (PCMBS), diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), sulindac, diclofenac, carprofen, glutarate and okadaic acid (By similarity). PAH uptake is inhibited by benzothiazolylcysteine (BTC), S-chlorotrifluoroethylcysteine (CTFC), cysteine S-conjugates S-dichlorovinylcysteine (DCVC), furosemide, steviol, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore A23187, benzylpenicillin, furosemide, indomethacin, bumetamide, losartan, probenecid, phenol red, urate, and alpha-ketoglutarate.</specific-function>

        <general-function>Xenobiotic-transporting atpase activity</general-function>
        <specific-function>High-capacity urate exporter functioning in both renal and extrarenal urate excretion. Plays a role in porphyrin homeostasis as it is able to mediates the export of protoporhyrin IX (PPIX) both from mitochondria to cytosol and from cytosol to extracellular space, and cellular export of hemin, and heme. Xenobiotic transporter that may play an important role in the exclusion of xenobiotics from the brain. Appears to play a major role in the multidrug resistance phenotype of several cancer cell lines. Implicated in the efflux of numerous drugs and xenobiotics: mitoxantrone, the photosensitizer pheophorbide, camptothecin, methotrexate, azidothymidine (AZT), and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin.</specific-function>
